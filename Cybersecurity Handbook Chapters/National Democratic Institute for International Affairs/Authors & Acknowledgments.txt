In developing this Handbook, we’d like
to particularly thank our expert external
reviewers who provided us with valuable
feedback, edits, and suggestions as we pulled
together this content, including:
Fiona Krakenburger, Open Technology Fund; Bill Budington
and Shirin Mori, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Jocelyn
Woolbright, Cloudflare; Martin Shelton, Freedom of the Press
Foundation; Dave Leichtman, Microsoft; Stephen Boyce,
International Foundation for Electoral Systems; Amy Studdart,
International Republican Institute; Emma Hollingsworth,
Global Cyber Alliance; Caroline Sinders, Convocation Design +

We also want to acknowledge all the incredible manuals,
guides, workbooks, training modules and other materials
developed and maintained by the Organizational Security

(OrgSec) Community. This Handbook is designed to
complement those more in-depth materials, combining key
lessons into a one-stop, easy-to-read resource for civil society
organizations looking to get started on a cybersecurity plan.
In addition to taking indirect inspiration from many wonderful
resources compiled by the community, we have directly copied
useful language from a handful of existing resources as well
throughout this Handbook, particularly the Electronic Frontier
Foundation’s Surveillance Self Defense Guide, Tactical Tech’s
Holistic Security Manual, and a range of explainers from the
Center for Democracy and Technology and the Freedom of
the Press Foundation. You can find specific citations to these
resources throughout the sections below, and complete links,
author, and license information within Appendix A.
We also strongly recommend that anyone reading this
Handbook make use of the extensive library of digital security
guides and resources compiled and updated by the Open
Technology Fund.
