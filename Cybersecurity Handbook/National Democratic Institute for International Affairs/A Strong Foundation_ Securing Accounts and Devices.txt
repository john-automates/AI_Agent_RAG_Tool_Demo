QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
•

How will you implement account security measures - like a password manager and 2FA - across the organization?
What obstacles might you encounter during implementation?

need a plan to address unlicensed software or computers?

•

When is a good time to set up training for all staff on the dangers of phishing, malware, and device security best
practices?
